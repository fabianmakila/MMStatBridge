A plugin to bridge Plugily-Projects Murder Mystery statistic PAPI placeholders to a server without having to have the full Murder Mystery plugin running on the server.
Designed mostly Hub/Lobby servers in mind.

You'll need to connect this plugin to the same MySQL database that the Murder Mystery is using.
